// Prospective warnings of potential issues when providing care to the patient.
type Flag struct {
	// Allows a flag to be divided into different categories like clinical, administrative etc. Intended to be used as a means of filtering which flags are displayed to particular user or in a given context.
	Category []types.CodeableConcept
	// The coded value or textual component of the flag to display to the user.
	Code types.CodeableConcept
	// The period of time from the activation of the flag to inactivation of the flag. If the flag is active, the end of the period should be unspecified.
	Period *types.Period
	// A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often, this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules along with other profiles etc.
	ImplicitRules *types.Uri
	// May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
	Extension []types.Extension
	// The patient, location, group, organization, or practitioner etc. this is about record this flag is associated with.
	Subject types.Reference
	// These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they have their own independent transaction scope.
	Contained []r4.Resource
	// May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.
	//
	// Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself).
	ModifierExtension []types.Extension
	// Business identifiers assigned to this flag by the performer or other systems which remain constant as the resource is updated and propagates from server to server.
	Identifier []types.Identifier
	// The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with version changes to the resource.
	Meta *types.Meta
	// A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative. Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety.
	Text *types.Narrative
	// Supports basic workflow.
	Status types.Code
	// This alert is only relevant during the encounter.
	Encounter *types.Reference
	// The person, organization or device that created the flag.
	Author *types.Reference
	// The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once assigned, this value never changes.
	Id *types.Id
	// The base language in which the resource is written.
	Language *types.Code
