// Basic is used for handling concepts not yet defined in FHIR, narrative-only resources that don't map to an existing resource, and custom resources not appropriate for inclusion in the FHIR specification.
//
// Need some way to safely (without breaking interoperability) allow implementers to exchange content not supported by the initial set of declared resources.
type Basic struct {
	// Identifies when the resource was first created.
	Created *types.Date
	// The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with version changes to the resource.
	Meta *types.Meta
	// A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often, this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules along with other profiles etc.
	ImplicitRules *types.Uri
	// These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they have their own independent transaction scope.
	Contained []r4.Resource
	// Identifies the 'type' of resource - equivalent to the resource name for other resources.
	Code types.CodeableConcept
	// Identifies the patient, practitioner, device or any other resource that is the "focus" of this resource.
	Subject *types.Reference
	// Identifier assigned to the resource for business purposes, outside the context of FHIR.
	Identifier []types.Identifier
	// Indicates who was responsible for creating the resource instance.
	Author *types.Reference
	// The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once assigned, this value never changes.
	Id *types.Id
	// The base language in which the resource is written.
	Language *types.Code
	// A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative. Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety.
	Text *types.Narrative
	// May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
	Extension []types.Extension
	// May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.
	//
	// Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself).
